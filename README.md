StellarStellaris Exception Translator - Web App
----------------------------

This repo contains the StellarStellaris Exception Translator web app; it also needs an PostGreSQL database populated with data from the executables using  the https://github.com/MattMills/stellar-except-automation repo.

The exec/ directory has been removed from this repo per discussion with legal@paradoxinteractive.com (Re: 7/18/2023 - 9/29/2023 thread), it contains executables from multiple versions of Stellaris for capstone analysis.

Capstone access is provided by php-capstone (https://github.com/firodj/php-capstone). Yes, really.
